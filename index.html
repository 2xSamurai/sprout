        <h1>Collection of React Native Components</h1>
        <p>No, this is not an npm package and wont be made into one anytime soon.</p>
        <p>Most of the time when using an npm package I found myself only using a small part of it and not the whole
            thing.
            So why not make a collection where you can just copy paste the things you want and configure it to your
            needs. This will keep your code clean.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also you wont have to worry about useless stuff while updating your codebase.

        <h3>Custom Slider using FlatList</h3>
        <p>
            Onboarding screen uses a "Slider.js" component for the sliding functinality. Under the hood the the "Slider.js" component uses a simple FlatList. If needed you can further extend the functinalities of FlatList.
        </p>

        <h3>Skip Button</h3>
        <p>Simple set the status of onboarding state in redux to false. Thereby hiding the onboarding screens.</p>

        <h3>Next Button</h3>
        <p>
            Uses the Flatlist's built-in scrollToIndex functionlity to slide to the next slide. Inside "Slider.js" is a scrollTo function which handles the logic.
        </p>

        <h3>Custom Components for each slide</h3>

        <p>
            Open "index.js" inside the onboarding folder. The number of slides to show is defined in this file. 
        </p>

        <pre><code>const onboardingItems = [
        { id: 1, component: &lt;StepOne /&gt; },
        { id: 2, component: &lt;StepTwo /&gt;  },
        { id: 3, component: &lt;StepThree /&gt;  },
    ]
</code></pre>
    <p>
        StepOne, StepTwo and StepThree are different componets used as slides for onboarding. In this template the header and footer are static though.
